            <p>
                I am 20 years old I do not have any pets and I am an only child. I am currently enrolled at East Carolina University looking to get a masters degree in computer sicence. I currently have only worked at one job and that was for 5 summers. I took karate for 8 years and with that it showed that even putting in years of work there are still more opportunities to learn.
